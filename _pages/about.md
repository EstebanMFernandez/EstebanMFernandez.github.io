I am a PhD Candidate in the Political Science department at MIT. I study the effect of popular culture on political outcomes in the United States with a focus on how pop culture influences public perceptions of the police. I am also interested in other areas of American politics and public opinion such as Latinx politics and Affective polarization. 

I am an experienced survey and quantitative scholar. I have designed, implemented, and analyzed numerous experimental and observational projects. I have also helped teach our department's Causal Inference course. I am affiliated with the [Global Diversity Lab](https://globaldiversitylab.mit.edu/)and the [Political Experiments Research Lab](https://polisci.mit.edu/research/projects/political-experiments-research-lab).

Before joining MIT I was a researcher at California State University, Fullerton's Center for Economic Education. I received a BA in Economics and Political Science and an MA in Economics at CSUF as well. 

When I am not working I enjoy playing/watching basketball, watching what my partner refers to as "long and pretentious" movies, and independent label/ Golden Era hip-hop.
